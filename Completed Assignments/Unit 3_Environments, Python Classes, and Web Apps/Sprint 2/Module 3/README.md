# The biggest different when working with MongoDB compared to sqlite3 is the way 
# the queries are written. It seems much easier to write complex queries in 
# mongodb than in sqlite3.

# Honestly I havent done enough with either to determine what is easier or harder.
# At the moment theyre both equally difficult to use which really isnt that difficult.
